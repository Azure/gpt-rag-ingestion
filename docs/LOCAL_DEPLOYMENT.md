## Running locally with VS Code

You can run the **data ingestion** locally in VS Code to contribute, adjust, test, or debug.

Ensure proper provisioning of cloud resources as per instructions in the [Enterprise RAG repo](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) before local deployment of the data ingestion function.

Once the cloud resources (such as Azure OpenAI, Azure KeyVault) have been provisioned as per the instructions mentioned earlier, follow these steps:  
   
1. Clone this repository.  

2. Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-python#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)

3. Ensure that your VS Code has the following extensions installed:  
  
   - [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)  
   - [Azurite (blob storage emulator)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Azurite.azurite)  
   
4. Refer to the sections [Key Vault Access Policies](#key-vault-access-policies) and [Storage Account Role](#storage-account-role) to grant the necessary roles and policies needed to run the function locally.  
   
5. Open VS Code in the directory where you cloned the repository.  
   
6. When opening it for the first time, create a virtual environment and point it to [Python version 3.10 or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/). <BR>Follow the examples illustrated in the images below.

7. Create a copy and then rename the file `local.settings.json.template` to `local.settings.json` and update it with your environment information.  
   
8. Before running the function locally, start the Azurite storage emulator. You can do this by double-clicking [Azurite Blob Service], located in the bottom right corner of the status bar.

9. Done! Now you just need to hit F5 (Start Debugging) to run the orchestrator function at  `http://localhost:7071/api/orc`.

**Note:** you can download this [Postman Collection](../tests/gpt-rag-ingestion.postman_collection.json) to test your orchestrator endpoint.

### Storage Account Role

To read the content of the **blob storage** when testing in a network-isolated environment, you'll also need to assign the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to the identity used by **DefaultAzureCredential**. If you're using the VM's identity, follow the example below:

Azure Storage Account **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role.

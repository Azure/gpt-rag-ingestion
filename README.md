# GPT on your data Ingestion

Part of [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag)

## Deploy (quickstart)

You provision the infrastructure and deploy the solution initially using the GPT-RAG template, as instructed at: https://aka.ms/gpt-rag.

To deploy only the ingestion component (after the initial deployment of the solution), you will need:

 - Azure Developer CLI: [Download azd for Windows](https://azdrelease.azureedge.net/azd/standalone/release/1.5.0/azd-windows-amd64.msi), [Other OS's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
 - Powershell (Windows only): [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package)
 - Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - Python 3.10: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)

Then just clone this repository and reproduce the following commands within the gpt-rag-ingestion directory:  

```
azd auth login  
azd env refresh  
azd deploy  
```

> Note: when running the azd env refresh, use the same environment name, subscription, and region used in the initial provisioning of the infrastructure.

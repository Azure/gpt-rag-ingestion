# GPT-RAG Data Ingestion

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

The **GPT-RAG Data Ingestion** service automates the processing of diverse document types‚Äîsuch as PDFs, images, spreadsheets, transcripts, and SharePoint files‚Äîpreparing them for indexing in Azure AI Search. It uses intelligent chunking strategies tailored to each format, generates text and image embeddings, and enables rich, multimodal retrieval experies for agent-based RAG applications.

## How Data Ingestion Works

The service performs the following steps:

* **Scan sources**: Detects new or updated files in configured locations
* **Process content**: Chunks and enriches data (text, images, embeddings) for retrieval
* **Index documents**: Writes processed chunks into Azure AI Search
* **Schedule execution**: Runs on a CRON-based scheduler defined by environment variables

**Supported connectors:** Blob Storage and SharePoint. See [Blob Connector](docs/blob_connector.md) for details.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the web application, you must provision the infrastructure as described in the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag/tree/feature/vnext-architecture) repo. This includes creating all necessary Azure resources required to support the application runtime.


## How to deploy the data ingestion service

Clone this repository and then run:
```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running `azd env refresh`, make sure to use the **same subscription**, **resource group**, and **environment name** that you used during the infrastructure deployment. This ensures consistency across components.



## Previous Releases

> [!NOTE]  
> For earlier versions, use the corresponding release in the GitHub repository (e.g., v1.0.0 for the initial version).

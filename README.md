# GPT on your data Ingestion

Part of [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag)

## Getting started

You can provision the infrastructure and deploy the whole solution using the GPT-RAG template, as instructed at: https://aka.ms/gpt-rag.

## What if I want to redeploy just the ingestion component?

Eventually, you may want to make some adjustments to the data ingestion code and redeploy the component.

To redeploy only the ingestion component (after the initial deployment of the solution), you will need:

 - Azure Developer CLI: [Download azd for Windows](https://azdrelease.azureedge.net/azd/standalone/release/1.5.0/azd-windows-amd64.msi), [Other OS's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
 - Powershell (Windows only): [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package)
 - Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - Python 3.11: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/)

Then just clone this repository and reproduce the following commands within the gpt-rag-ingestion directory:  

```
azd auth login  
azd env refresh  
azd deploy  
```

> Note: when running the ```azd env refresh```, use the same environment name, subscription, and region used in the initial provisioning of the infrastructure.

## Running Locally with VS Code  
   
[How can I test the data ingestion component locally in VS Code?](docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Document Intelligence API version

To use version 4.0 of Document Intelligence, it is necessary to add the property `DOCINT_API_VERSION` with the value `2024-02-29-preview` in the function app properties. It's important to check if this version is supported in the region where the service was created. More information can be found at [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-layout?view=doc-intel-4.0.0). If the property has not been defined (default behavior), the version `2023-07-31` (3.1) will be used.

# Supported input formats for data ingestion


**Document Intelligence Chunking**

| Extension | Doc Int API version |
|-----------|-------------------|
| pdf       | 3.1, 4.0          |
| bmp       | 3.1, 4.0          |
| jpeg      | 3.1, 4.0          |
| png       | 3.1, 4.0          |
| tiff      | 3.1, 4.0          |
| docx      | 4.0               |
| pptx      | 4.0               |
| xlsx      | 4.0               |
| html      | 4.0               |

**Langchain text Splitters Chunking**

| Extension | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| txt       | text   |
| html      | html   |
| shtml     | html   |
| htm       | html   |
| py        | python |
| pdf       | pdf    |
| json      | json   |
| csv       | csv    |
| epub      | epub   |
| rtf       | rtf    |
| xml       | xml    |
| xlsx      | xlsx   |
| xls       | xls    |
| pptx      | pptx   |
| ppt       | ppt    |
| msg       | msg    |

Note: First, based on the file extension check if it can be processed with Document Intelligence and then chunked. If not, just use the content extracted by AI Search and attempt to perform chunking with Langchain text splitter.

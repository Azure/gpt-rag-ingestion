# GPT-RAG Data Ingestion

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

The **GPT-RAG Data Ingestion** service automates the processing of diverse document types‚Äîsuch as PDFs, images, spreadsheets, transcripts, and SharePoint files‚Äîpreparing them for indexing in Azure AI Search. It uses intelligent chunking strategies tailored to each format, generates text and image embeddings, and enables rich, multimodal retrieval experies for agent-based RAG applications.

## How Data Ingestion Works

The service performs the following steps:

* **Scan sources**: Detects new or updated content in configured sources
* **Process content**: Chunk and enrich data for retrieval
* **Index documents**: Writes processed chunks into Azure AI Search
* **Schedule execution**: Runs on a CRON-based scheduler defined by environment variables

## Supported data sources

- [Blob Storage](docs/blob_data_source.md)
- [NL2SQL Metadata](docs/nl2sql_data_source.md)
- SharePoint

## How to deploy the data ingestion service

### Prerequisites

Provision the infrastructure first by following the GPT-RAG repository instructions [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag/tree/feature/vnext-architecture). This ensures all required Azure resources (e.g., Container App, Storage, AI Search) are in place before deploying the web application.

The machine used to customize and or deploy the service should have:

* Azure CLI: [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* Azure Developer CLI (optional, if using azd): [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
* Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Python 3.12: [Download Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)
* Docker CLI: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* VS Code (recommended): [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
</details>

To customize the service, your user should have the following roles:

| Resource                | Role                                | Description                                 |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| App Configuration Store | App Configuration Data Owner        | Full control over configuration settings    |
| Container Registry      | AcrPush                             | Push and pull container images              |
| AI Search Service       | Search Index Data Contributor       | Read and write index data                   |
| Storage Account         | Storage Blob Data Contributor       | Read and write blob data                    |
| Cosmos DB               | Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor | Read and write documents in Cosmos DB       |

To deploy the service, assign these roles to your user or service principal:

| Resource                                   | Role                             | Description           |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| App Configuration Store                    | App Configuration Data Reader    | Read config           |
| Container Registry                         | AcrPush                          | Push images           |
| Azure Container App                        | Azure Container Apps Contributor | Manage Container Apps |

Ensure the deployment identity has these roles at the correct scope (subscription or resource group).

### Deployment steps

Make sure you're logged in to Azure before anything else:

```bash
az login
```

Clone this repository.

#### If you used `azd provision`

Just run:

```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you use the **same** subscription, resource group, environment name, and location from `azd provision`.

#### If you did **not** use `azd provision`

You need to set the App Configuration endpoint and run the deploy script.

#### Bash (Linux/macOS):

```bash
export APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT="https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

#### PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
$env:APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

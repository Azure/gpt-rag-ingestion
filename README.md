# GPT on your data Ingestion

Part of [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag)

## Deploy (quickstart)

Here are the steps to configure cognitive search and deploy ingestion code using the terminal.

**First Check your environment meets the requirements**

- You need **[AZ CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)** to log and run Azure commands in the command line.
- **Python 3.9+** to run the setup script. Ideally use **Python 3.10** (the same version used by the Function runtime).  
- **[Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-python#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)** will be needeed to deploy the chunking function.

**1) Login to Azure** 

run ```az login``` to log into azure. Run ```az login -i``` if using a VM with managed identity to run the setup.

**2) Clone the repo** 

If you plan to customize the ingestion logic, create a new repo by clicking on the **Use this template** button on top of this page.

Clone the repostory locally:  ```git clone https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag-ingestion```

*If you created a new repository please update the repository URL before running the command*

**3) Deploy function to Azure** 

Enter in the cloned repo folder: ```cd gpt-rag-ingestion```

Use Azure Functions Core Tools to deploy the function: ```func azure functionapp publish FUNCTION_APP_NAME --python```

<!-- Check the function is listed after deployment: ```func azure functionapp list-functions FUNCTION_APP_NAME``` -->

*Replace FUNCTION_APP_NAME with your Ingestion Function App name before running the command*

**4) Run Azure Cognitive Search Setup**

Enter in the cloned repo folder: ```cd gpt-rag-ingestion```

Install python libraries: ```pip install -r requirements.txt --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver```

Run the setup script: ```python setup.py -s SUBSCRIPTION_ID -r RESOURCE_GROUP -f FUNCTION_APP_NAME```

*Replace SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP and FUNCTION_APP_NAME by the names applicable to your environment*

If you get "ERROR: Failed building wheel for tiktoken", you should install rust compiler toolchain from https://rustup.rs .

<!-- *Add -i command line argument when executing setup.py if using a VM with managed identity to run the setup.* -->


**5) Add source documents to object storage** 

Upload your documents to the *documents* folder in the storage account which name starts with *strag*.

**Optional: use managed identity to connect to Azure Function**

If you want that AI Search use its Managed Identity to access the Azure Function, run setup with additional arguments:

 ```python setup.py -s SUBSCRIPTION_ID -r RESOURCE_GROUP -f FUNCTION_APP_NAME -a SEARCH_PRINCIPAL_ID -m true```

Where *SEARCH_PRINCIPAL_ID* is the object (principal) ID of the Search service.

Note: In order for the data ingestion function to be accessed with a managed identity, it needs to be configured to use Microsoft Entra Sign-in, as indicated [in this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad).

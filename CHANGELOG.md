## [v2.2.1] – 2026-01-19
### Fixed
- Improved reliability of large spreadsheet ingestion (which generate thousands of embedding calls prone to transient rate limits) by adding robust retry with exponential backoff for Azure OpenAI calls (handles 429/Retry-After and is configurable via `OPENAI_RETRY_*` and `OPENAI_SDK_MAX_RETRIES`).
- Reduced unexpected restarts during long runs by ensuring Azure Container Apps targets port `8080` during deployment (avoids transient probe failures caused by mismatched target port that could interrupt pipeline processing).

## [v2.2.0] – 2026-01-15
### Added
- Document-level security enforcement for GPT-RAG using Azure AI Search native ACL/RBAC trimming with end-user identity propagation via `x-ms-query-source-authorization`.
	Includes permission-aware indexing metadata (`userIds`, `groupIds`, `rbacScope`), safe-by-default behavior for requests without a valid user token, and optional elevated-read debugging support.

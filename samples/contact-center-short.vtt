Customer: Hi, I'm looking at my phone bill, and there's a charge I'm not sure about.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Agent: Hello! I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me which charge you're referring to?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Customer: Sure, it says "Service Fee - $15.99". What exactly is that for?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000
Agent: That fee is for your international calling plan. It covers a monthly subscription that allows you to make calls to other countries at a reduced rate.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Customer: I see. I don’t remember signing up for that. Is it optional?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.000
Agent: Yes, it is optional. You may have added it when you signed up for your service, but I can assist you in removing it if you no longer need it.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Customer: That would be great. I don't make international calls, so I’d like to remove it.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Agent: Understood. I’ll remove the international calling plan from your account. Your next bill will reflect the change, and you won’t see the $15.99 charge again.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
Customer: Thank you! That clears things up.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for your help.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Agent: My pleasure! Have a great day!

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Customer: You too, bye!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.000
Agent: Goodbye!
